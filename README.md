## üí° How It Works

The core logic for palette generation is based on finding the "closest" color within a predefined set of palettes. When you select a color, the app calculates the **Euclidean distance** in the RGB color space between your color and every color in the library. It then selects the palette containing the color with the smallest distance, ensuring the generated palette is a harmonious match for your selection.
